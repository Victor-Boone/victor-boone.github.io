I am Victor Boone, Post-Doc at the Université Grenoble Alpes in the [POLARIS](https://www.inria.fr/fr/polaris) team as well as a teacher assistant at the UGA. 
My work focuses on Reinforcement Learning, Multi-Armed Bandits and Game Theory.

You can join me via email `victor.boone@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr`. 

I am just a curious fellow that tries to explain what I actually see on my computer when I run learning algorithms, by pushing theory to its limits. 
I am concerned with finite Markov decision processes, stochastic bandits and finite games in normal form. 

My PhD thesis is about *higher order* guarantees or requirements in reinforcement learning and is done under the supervision of [Bruno Gaujal](https://team.inria.fr/polaris/members/bruno-gaujal/) and [Panayotis Mertikopoulos](https://polaris.imag.fr/panayotis.mertikopoulos/).
