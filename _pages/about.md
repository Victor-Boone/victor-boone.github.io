I am Victor Boone, currently Post-Doc at the Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse, [IRIT](https://www.irit.fr).
My work focuses on Reinforcement Learning, Multi-Armed Bandits, Game Theory and Queuing Theory (more recently).

You can join me via email `victor.boone@irit.fr` or `boonevv@gmail.com`. 

I am just a curious fellow that tries to explain what I actually see on my computer when I run learning algorithms, by pushing theory to its limits. 
I am concerned with finite Markov decision processes, stochastic bandits and finite games in normal form. 
During my PhD, I have been mostly focusing on regret minimization in Markov decision processes.
More recently, my focus is shifting towards infinitely large systems topped with learning considerations, such as queuing systems.
Stay tuned!

I did my PhD thesis under the supervision of [Bruno Gaujal](https://team.inria.fr/polaris/members/bruno-gaujal/) and [Panayotis Mertikopoulos](https://polaris.imag.fr/panayotis.mertikopoulos/) and have defended on November 2024. My manuscript is entirely dedicated to regret minimization in Markov decision processes in the undiscounted infinite horizon setting. Check it out [here](assets/pdf/VBOONE-manuscript-v1.1.pdf)!
I've even received a prize for it, the [prix de th√®se UGA 2025](https://doctorat.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/college-doctoral/prix-de-these-2025-10-jeunes-docteures-et-docteurs-distingues-par-l-uga-1593456.kjsp)! Hurray!
